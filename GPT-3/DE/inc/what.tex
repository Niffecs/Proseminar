\chapter{What are probabilistic databases?}
Probabilistic databases are a type of database that uses probability to represent uncertain or incomplete information. In a probabilistic database, data is represented as a set of random variables that can take on different values with certain probabilities. This allows the database to represent and reason about uncertain or incomplete information in a mathematically rigorous way. \\

Probabilistic databases are often used in applications where it is difficult or impossible to obtain complete and accurate data, such as in natural language processing, robotics, and other areas. For example, a probabilistic database could be used to represent the uncertain locations of objects in a robot's environment, or the uncertain meanings of words in a natural language text. \\

Probabilistic databases can be useful for handling uncertain or incomplete information, but they also have some limitations and challenges. For example, representing and reasoning about uncertainty in a probabilistic database requires careful modeling and management of the data, and probabilistic databases can be computationally intensive.
