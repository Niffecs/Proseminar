\chapter{Introduction}

Probabilistic databases are a class of databases that allow for uncertainty in data, providing a more accurate representation of real-world phenomena that are inherently uncertain. In this paper, we will explore the features and advantages of probabilistic databases, as well as some of the challenges and potential applications of this technology. We will also discuss the underlying probabilistic models and algorithms used in probabilistic databases, and how they enable more nuanced and informative query processing. Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of probabilistic databases for theoretical computer scientists.
