\chapter{Summary}

Probabilistic databases are a type of database that can handle uncertainty in data. They allow for the representation and manipulation of uncertain information, and they can make probabilistic inferences about the data. As a result, probabilistic databases are becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of applications, including sensor networks, financial analysis, and natural language processing. When probabilistic databases are used to analyze data, the resulting information is often presented in the form of graphs, which can help to visualize the uncertainty and relationships in the data. These graphs can be used to make more informed decisions and to better understand the data.
