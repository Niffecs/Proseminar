\chapter{What are the advantages of probabilistic databases?}

Probabilistic databases are a type of database that can handle uncertainty in data. Some advantages of probabilistic databases include the ability to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Store and manipulate uncertain or incomplete information, such as data with missing values or conflicting information.
	
	\item Make probabilistic inferences about the data, such as estimating the likelihood of different scenarios or predicting missing values.
	
	\item Handle large amounts of data more efficiently than traditional databases, since they can store and process uncertain information in a compact and scalable way.
	
\end{enumerate}

These advantages make probabilistic databases particularly useful in applications where data is noisy or uncertain, such as in sensor networks, financial analysis, or natural language processing.
